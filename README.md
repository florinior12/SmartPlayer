# SmartPlayer - WORK IN PROGRESS

Project for University - music suggestion app.

The app will allow the user to search for music on Youtube, access the results, and hit a like button.

Liked songs will be then used for generating suggestions.

Currently the app is able to connect tou Youtube API in order to search for songs and add liked songs to a MySQL database.
The web app is made using Python and the Flask framework.
