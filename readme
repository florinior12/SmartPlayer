For Ubuntu 16.04	

1. The app first requires a MySQL database to be imported:
	If you don’t have a MySQL server installed, please follow a basic tutorial like this one https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-basic-mysql-tutorial
	After configuring the server, log in using
		mysql -u <mysql_username> -p
	Now we are using the mysql shell. Create the database that we’re going to use
		create database smart_player;
	Select it
		use smart_player;
	Import the data necessary using (where smart_player.sql is the file contained with the archive that I sent)
		source smart_player.sql;
	Now if you type 
		show tables;
	You should see a table named “songs”. Now to exit the mysql shell type
		exit;
2. To configure the database, enter your mysql username and password in config.py at this line
	SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://<mysql_username>:<mysql_password>@localhost:3306/smart_player'
3. Then we will need a virtual environment manager to use in order to have the required packages. I used Anaconda. 
	Download Anaconda from here https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux
	To find python version type in terminal
		python --version
4. To install Anaconda open terminal in download folder of the file and type
	bash <downloaded_file_name>
	the downloaded file name should be something like Anaconda*-*.*.*-Linux-x86-**.sh
5. Then to set up the environment open the terminal in the folder of the project, make sure that the file environment.yml is there because it will be used to create the environment containing all the used packages and type (this will take a while)
	conda env create -f environment.yml
6. Now to activate the environment type in terminal
	source activate proiect2_test
7. Start the app by typing
	python run.py
